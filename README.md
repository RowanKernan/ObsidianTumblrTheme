# ObsidianTumblrTheme
Creation of a Tumblr styling for Obsidian, made as part of Obsidian October 2021

- Dark mode only
- (I haven't worked out how to change it for light mode...yet.)
- I also never use light mode for anything other than my Bullet Journal vault so I'm not as familiar with it / fond of it. 

## Design Ideas
- If it didn't work out then it fits with Tumblr's "break something but add a feature that nobody wants or cares about" 
- Background colour and sidebar colour are both Tumblr dashboard colours, the workspace colour is a previous one than the current Tumblr dash. 
- Header colours are taken from the post types (excluding Text)

## Installing - GitHub
1. Download the "ObsidianTumblrTheme.css" file
2. Move file to "(Your Vault Name)/.obsidian/theme"
3. Go to your Obsidian vault, click settings, and browse themes. You should see this appear in the list.
